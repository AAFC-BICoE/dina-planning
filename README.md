# Glossary
[Glossary](https://github.com/AAFC-BICoE/dina-planning/blob/master/docs/glossary.md) of terms used in DINA.

# Usage
* Main unit of work is [issue](https://github.com/AAFC-BICoE/dina-planning/issues)
* [Projects](https://github.com/AAFC-BICoE/dina-planning/projects) are views for the clients representing status of the current known requirements/issues
* Issue should be closed by the client after validation
  * dev team then moves the issues from column to column (in [projects](https://github.com/AAFC-BICoE/dina-planning/projects))
* Labels are used to identify the source of the issue ( requirements/issues vs feedback from demos/etc)
  * requirements should always link back to the DINA-Web specification repositories when applicable
* dev issues should link to GitHub issues, not the other way around
* [milestones](https://github.com/AAFC-BICoE/dina-planning/milestones) could be used to define the "version" where the issue will be addressed
